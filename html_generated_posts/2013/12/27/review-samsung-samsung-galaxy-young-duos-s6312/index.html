            <h1>Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 review 2013</h1>
<p>The  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 is the company&#39;s take on Android, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) phones with 3.27 inches, 320 x 480 pixels inches screen. The handset giant is advertising the phone with many efforts. There&#39;s also a major shift in terms of the build of the phone and in some other attributes.  </p>

<p>We will try to find in this review that whether this phone can make it in the top lead of Android, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) mobile phones.</p>
<h2>Build/ Design</h2>
<p>When seen from far, it appear as a regular mobile phone, but a closer look proved it this new  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 is pretty well designed and slick phone.  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 has better design than Motorola Motorola Moto G and XOLO Xolo A500s IPS, and it even feels more compact. The phone has sexy rounded edges. It&#39;s available in different colour variants which might feel good to some people.</p>

<p>The front of the Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 features a 3.27 inches, 320 x 480 pixels 5-inch display and the earpiece,  , notification LED and the sensor array above it.</p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 features the Power / Screen lock key and the Volume rocker key at the right hand side, and two micro-SIM trays at the left side. The Micro-USB port sits at the top edge of the phone, while the 3.5mm headset jack is located at the bottom edge.</p>

<p>The back of the  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 is dominated by a cover which is flanked by two plastic strips at the top and bottom. The Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 houses the 3.15 MP-megapixel camera lens that protrudes out a little,  and a big LED flash .</p>

<p>The bottom strip houses the speaker grill of the phone. There&#39;s some  branding at the middle of the Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 in the form of a logo.</p>

<p>Overall, the build quality of the  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 can be considered the best among all other  phones of similar range and category. The phone is well-built, exudes a feeling of durability and feels nice to hold. Despite sporting a 3.27 inches, 320 x 480 pixels-inch display, the phone is perfect for one-hand use.</p>
<h2>Display of  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312</h2>
<p>The  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 comes with a 3.27 inches, 320 x 480 pixels-inch display with pixels resolution and pixel density of ppi.</p>

<p>The screen is one of the phone&#39;s headline features, and thanks to that text and images looked crisp and sharp but we were not very impressed with the display&#39;s colour reproduction, specially how it displayed blacks.  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312&#39;s screen also looked a bit dull, and brightness levels were below par if you compare it with phones like the Motorola Motorola Moto G.</p>
<h2>Camera of  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 supports a 3.15 MP-megapixel rear camera .  offers its support for camera app that includes Normal,<br>
HDR, Smile detection, Panorama and Scene detection shot modes.</p>

<p>In our use, we found the camera of the  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 to be a bit off in terms of white balance and it softened the tone to a cooler shade. Images clicked with the phone&#39;s rear camera lacked warmth and at times looked very bland. Images taken during the day were still passable but the ones taken in indoor light appeared totally different from the prevailing ambient light conditions.</p>

<p>Overall, the cameras on the Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 are strictly average for a phone in this segment.</p>
<h2>Software/ User Interface of  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312</h2>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 runs Android, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), which is a very recent version of the OS and comes with some skinned elements of the UI like the app icons.</p>

<p>&#39;s custom UI layer is not as radical as HTC&#39;s Sense UI or Samsung&#39;s TouchWiz UI, but does add some customisation and third party apps.</p>

<p>Just like the Motorola Motorola Moto G, the  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 also features some software tricks, including a new lock screen mechanism that allows the phone to be unlocked with a blow of air or if the phone is shaken. It works as promised but disables the lock screen widgets, so we just feel it&#39;s too gimmicky. It&#39;s not enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Performance of  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312</h2>
<p>The  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon S1 MSM7625a Processor  1 GHz processor with 768 MB  RAM onboard. There is  4 GB of internal storage.</p>

<p>With Android, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), the overall experience of navigation through the interface was pleasant, thanks to the phone&#39;s quad-core processor. We did not<br>
experience any lag while launching apps, playing games, scrolling web pages or switching between apps. It is safe to say that performance wise, the Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 scores well.</p>

<p>The  Samsung Galaxy Young Duos S6312 comes with a 1300 mAH, Li-ion Battery battery, and based on our experience, it will last you 250 hours on 3G. With medium to heavy usage, including 1-1.5 hours<br>
of phone calls, two e-mail accounts with push notifications, screen at maximum brightness, playing some music and video clips (about an hour), casual web<br>
browsing, Twitter notifications and WhatsApp chats, the phone lasted 400 minutes on 3G.</p>
